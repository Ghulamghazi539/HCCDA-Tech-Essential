LAB : Process of creating a VPC, two subnets, custom route tables, security groups, and an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) to distribute traffic to two backend servers

üõ†Ô∏è Practical Implementation

1.Create a VPC with CIDR block (e.g., 192.168.0.0/16)

2.Add Two Subnets:

192.168.1.0/24 (Public)

192.168.2.0/24 (Private)

3.Create Custom Route Tables

Associate public subnet with internet gateway

Associate private subnet with NAT gateway (optional)

4.Create Security Groups

Allow HTTP/HTTPS on public subnet

Restrict access to database on private subnet

5.Deploy ECS Instances in each subnet

6.Set Up Load Balancer (ELB)

Register backend ECS instances

Configure listener (e.g., HTTP port 80)

Health checks and target groups
