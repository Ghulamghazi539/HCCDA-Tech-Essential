Networking Services: VPC, Subnets, and Load Balancing

🧠 Networking Services Overview
🌐 1. Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
A VPC is a logically isolated network in the cloud where you can launch cloud resources (e.g., servers, databases). It gives full control over IP ranges, subnets, route tables, and gateways.

🧱 2. Subnets
Subnets divide a VPC into smaller network segments.

Public Subnet: Exposed to the internet (e.g., web servers)

Private Subnet: Internal communication only (e.g., databases)

🛣️ 3. Custom Route Tables
Route tables direct traffic between subnets, internet gateways, and NAT. You can define custom paths for specific subnets.

🔐 4. Security Groups
Security groups act like virtual firewalls controlling inbound and outbound traffic to ECS instances (virtual servers) based on rules.

⚖️ 5. Load Balancer (ELB)
An Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) automatically distributes incoming traffic across multiple backend servers, improving availability and scalability.
