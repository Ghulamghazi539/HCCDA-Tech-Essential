### âœ… 1. **Set Up a Lab on Huawei Cloud (General Approach)**

To create a computer services lab, you typically need:

* Virtual machines (ECS â€“ Elastic Cloud Server)
* Networking (VPC, security groups)
* Storage (EVS, OBS)
* Optional: AI services, container services, or cloud desktop.

#### **Step-by-Step Example: Build a Basic Lab on Huawei Cloud**

1. **Create an Account**: [Huawei Cloud Signup](https://intl.huaweicloud.com/)
2. **Create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)**:

   * Define subnets, security groups, and routing.
3. **Provision ECS Instances**:

   * Use Ubuntu/Windows servers
   * Install development tools (VS Code, Jupyter, Python, etc.)
4. **Add Storage**:

   * Use **Elastic Volume Service (EVS)** or **Object Storage Service (OBS)**.
5. **Enable Remote Access**:

   * Set up SSH (Linux) or RDP (Windows).
6. **Optional Services**:

   * **Cloud Container Engine (CCE)** â€“ for Kubernetes.
   * **ModelArts** â€“ for AI/ML labs.
   * **Cloud Desktop (WKS)** â€“ virtual desktop environment.
